Simulation prototype

Quick start

- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click) to run the prototype.
- The page uses p5.js from CDN; no build step required.

What's included

- `index.html`: UI and canvas entrypoint
- `src/sketch.js`: p5.js simulation (particles, simple probabilistic binding)
- `src/scoring.js`: deterministic scoring engine matching the prototype math
- `puzzle_example.json`: an example puzzle (4 tissues × 6 receptor floats)

Next steps

- Replace the example ligand configuration with RFID/CV input.
- Tune fidelity slider to match prototype scoring.
